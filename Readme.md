# Simple LSTM RNN

A minimal and easy-to-understand implementation of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Recurrent Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras. This project is aimed at beginners looking to understand how LSTMs work for sequence modeling problems.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Clean and minimalistic implementation using `tensorflow.keras`
- ✅ Easy to extend for custom sequence learning tasks
- ✅ Includes preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps

## 🧠 What is an LSTM?
LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory. It is a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data by retaining information over long periods. 

Traditional RNNs tend to struggle with long sequences due to the vanishing gradient problem. LSTMs solve this using three gates:

- **Input Gate**: Controls how much of the new input should be written to memory
- **Forget Gate**: Controls how much of the existing memory to forget
- **Output Gate**: Controls how much of the memory to expose as output

These gates make LSTMs highly effective for tasks involving:
- Time series prediction
- Natural language processing (e.g. text generation, sentiment analysis)
- Sequence classification

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🧰 Setup using Conda (Recommended)
```bash
conda create -n lstm_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate lstm_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook LSTM_RNN.ipynb
```

---

## ⚙️ Model Architecture
The model uses Keras Sequential API:

- `LSTM`: Core layer to handle sequential data
- `Dense`: Final output layer (could be binary or multi-class)

Sample architecture:
```python
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(128, input_shape=(time_steps, features)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

## 📊 Dataset
This repo uses synthetic sequential data generated within the notebook. You can replace it with your custom dataset:
- Format: `(samples, time_steps, features)`
- You can use `numpy`, `pandas`, or any other method for data preprocessing

---

## 🔁 How It Works
1. **Data Generation**: Synthetic sequences are generated in the notebook for demonstration
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is reshaped and normalized
3. **Model Building**: An LSTM layer is stacked followed by a dense output layer
4. **Training**: Model is trained using `binary_crossentropy` and the Adam optimizer
5. **Evaluation**: Loss and accuracy are monitored during training and test predictions are plotted

---

## 🛠️ Customization
You can modify the model or dataset for use cases like:
- Time series forecasting (e.g., stock prices)
- Sentiment classification
- Character-level text generation
